<h1> Project Summary </h1>

This dataset consists of TV shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2021. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine. In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming service's number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. We will be exploring other such insights obtained from the same dataset along with some clustering model implementation.


<h1> Problem Statement </h1>

In this project, we are required to do the following:
* Exploratory Data Analysis.
* Finally and most importantly, clustering similar content by matching text-based features.


<h1> Getting to Know the Data </h1>

* There are 7787 rows and 12 columns in the dataset.
* The issue of duplicate values is not there in the dataset.
* The are is a total of 3631 missing/null values in the dataset. The missing values are there in the 'director', 'cast', 'country', 'date_added' and 'rating' columns only.
